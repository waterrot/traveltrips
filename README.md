# UX

I made a simple and mobile friendly website with an eye for speed and readability. It also contains modals, jumbotrons, accordions, links, button e.g.

- Home page: Contains a slider with 3 slides. on each slide you have a picure with a jumbotron. on the jumbotron you have some text and a button to the page where the picture is about. And on the bottom of the page are 3 cards about all the countries who is responsive, 1 card will disapear on tablet size and on mobile size they will be under eachother.
- About us page: Contains a picure with a jumbotron with an image and some text about our vision. And on the bottom of the page are 3 cards about all the people that work at the company, this one is also responsive, 1 card will disapear on tablet size and on mobile size they will be under eachother.
- Canada page: first a couple of information sections with images (with alt text) and text and links to the modal where they can get in touch. and under that is a section with an accordion effect, a field with text and links will pop up when you click on the accordion button.
- Netherlands page: first a couple of information sections with images (with alt text) and text and links to the modal where they can get in touch. and under that is a section with an accordion effect, a field with text and links will pop up when you click on the accordion button.
- Italy page: first a couple of information sections with images (with alt text) and text and links to the modal where they can get in touch. and under that is a section with an accordion effect, a field with text and links will pop up when you click on the accordion button.

- [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to build faster and use the classes Bootstrap has already written.

## Testing
In the next picture you can see that I safed a lot of time with compressing all the images:

The result of this and the way I coded result in a fast website who almost loads under 1s and is less then 1 MB.

### Acknowledgements

#### footer
Code from the mini project "make your own cv" of the Code Instituut was the basic inspiration for the footer.
to make it a bit more interactive I used:
https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/ to give a delay in the color change when you hover over one of the links in the footer.
To make the email clickable I used https://www.handleidinghtml.nl/html/hyperlinks/hyperlinks09.html as inspiration.
To make the phone number clickable I used https://webdev-il.blogspot.com/2011/03/how-to-make-html-link-to-call-phone.html as inspiration.

#### basic structure
I used a lot of Bootstrap to make the website look nice. When I needed to create a new element I used Bootstrap for a basic structure and then customized it to make it fit into my website.
